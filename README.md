Four required .csv DataFrames: (DataFrame, Status)
    1-category.csv, complete
    2-subcategory.csv, complete
    3-campaign.csv, missing columns category ID and subcategory ID after many attempts to merge
    4-contacts.csv option 1, far from complete. If a second attempt is allowed on projects, I'll try option 2.

CrowdFunding.xlsm is complete.

The crowdfunding database, was unsubmitted.

This project was a very thorough test to what we've gone over in class to date. I would have liked to finish if only for the practice, so I intend to pick up where I left off in the future.

I'd like to acknowledge Othmane Benyoucef and Bryan Harris for allowing me the time to get this far. Starting over when everyone in class is finished isn't the easiest but I'm grateful for the option to do so.

If ever in need of support or have questions, you may send comments to soonerlisa23@hotmail.com
